Bot interference ideas:

(1) -  Main Bot Post (pinned) where students can type in and find stuff 
(doesn't really do what we want i.e. we're just making
a better search engine and not a huge chance of a large percentage of students using it)
and then the bot can scrape and determine other similar posts and follow up with all similar posts

(2) - After Bot notices a new post, it finds all the similar ones to it and follows up on the new post 
with all similar posts and also marks the original as a duplicate <- seems to be the best way

(3) - Piazza extension way (ParQR) <- not possible through API only

Piazza API - (things within the bot's capability)

posts: get_post, iter_all_posts, create_post, create_followup, create_instructor_answer, 
        create_reply, update_post, mark_as_duplicate, resolve_post, pin_post, delete_post

# Doesn't concern the bot
users: get_users, iter_users, get_all_users, iter_all_users, add_students, remove_users,
